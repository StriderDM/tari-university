# Introduction to I2P
## The invisible internet project

---
# What is I2P

* Anonymity network 
* Secure network (Communication is encrypted)
* Low-latency network
* Generally confused with Tor / VPN networks

---

# How does it work
* Enclosed network within the internet
* Peer to peer communication
  * Very little communication with internet
  * Has it's own websites - Eepsites
  * no IP address but cryptographic ID's. 
 * Each Connected client is a router
